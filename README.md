# Employee Management System cum Task Manager

In this project, I learned key concepts in React.js, such as two-way data binding with forms, using localStorage, and styling with Tailwind CSS. While simple, the effort I put into it has been rewarding. Overall, this project has been a great learning experience and growth opportunity as a developer.
